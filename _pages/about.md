I have over 13 years of experience in agricultural research, specializing in cereal physiology, agronomy, and farming systems research. I currently work as a Research Scientist with the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), where I focus on agronomic and systems innovations to enhance farm profitability in the low- and medium-rainfall zones of Western Australia.

Before joining DPIRD, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Crop Production at the University of Melbourne, where I contributed to redesigning broadacre farming systems in Southeast Victoria and and integrating dual-purpose winter wheat to bridge the winter feed gap in mixed farming systems. I have also collaborated and visited CIMMYT’s Campo Experimental Norman E. Borlaug wheat research station in Ciudad Obregón, Mexico as part of my PhD research.

I hold a PhD in Agricultural Sciences from the University of Melbourne and am passionate about improving the profitability and sustainability of dryland farming systems.
